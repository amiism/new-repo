**Aim** 
Sendhelplah is a platform for NUS students to find help from other students especially during COVID-19, where meetups are not recommended. Due to the covid situation, most classes were held online, making hard for students to make new friends and seek academic help. Hence, this website aims to allow users to get academic help and allow students to make friends at the same time. Other features allow students to make some quick bucks by selling their notes on the platform.

**Features**
* Register/ Login for NUS users
* Users can sell their used textbooks/notes on the platform
* Users can also post their questions related to the module channels that they have joined to generate discussions

**Limitations**
*current sign ups only allowed for student with NUS emails
